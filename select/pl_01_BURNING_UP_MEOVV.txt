가는 길은 blazing
Damn I feel amazing
주저하지 말고 hold me
버려 hesitation
뿌리쳐 temptation
말만 하지 말고 show me
Run to you 숨이 멈춰도 돼
Oh I'll give it all night and day
Got me burning
Got me burning up
Tell the DJ turn it
Turn it, turn it up
Yeah you got me burning
Got me burning up
Can you make my body work, make it
Shake it, shake it, shake it
뜨겁게 I make it
모두 태워 bet it on me
Take it, take it, take it
뺏길 바엔 다 뺏지
가질 거야 like they owe me
Yo 비교 말어 I'm the player one
미칠듯한 온도 better run like
Tssss MEOVV heating up
Tssss so hot feel the rush
I wanna I wanna
Get higher than this step back
I get what I get
Then stack it up, stack it up like
Run to you 숨이 멈춰도 돼
Oh I'll give it all night and day
Got me burning
Got me burning up
Tell the DJ turn it
Turn it, turn it up
Yeah you got me burning
Got me burning up
Can you make my body work, make it
Got me burning up, make it
Got me burning up, make it
우린 끝까지 가
We gon' let the fire burn
It's like a wildfire
Imma stay right by ya
Come take me up higher
Burning burning burning up
It's like a wildfire
Imma stay right by ya
Come take me up higher
Let it, let it, let it, let it burn
